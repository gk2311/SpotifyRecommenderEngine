    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Spotify is a digital music streaming service that offers users access to millions of songs, podcasts, and videos from artists all around the world. Started in Sweden in 2006, Spotify has grown exponentially to become one of the leading music streaming platforms globally. As of 2021, it has over 365 million monthly active users, including more than 165 million paying subscribers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spotify operates under a freemium model, offering users a basic, ad-supported service for free, while premium subscribers pay for additional features like ad-free listening and offline playback. Spotify's vast catalog, spanning virtually every genre of music, allows users to not only listen to their favorite songs but also discover new music.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spotify's Recommender Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "Spotify's recommender system is one of its defining features. It plays a crucial role in curating personalized content and creating a unique listening experience for each user. The engine leverages a mixture of collaborative filtering, natural language processing (NLP), audio analysis, and deep learning techniques to recommend songs and artists to users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative filtering identifies patterns in user behavior to make recommendations. It operates under the assumption that if users A and B both like song X, and user A also likes song Y, then it's likely that user B will also enjoy song Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural language processing (NLP) is used to analyze textual data like playlist titles, song descriptions, and artist biographies to extract meaningful patterns and associations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Audio analysis focuses on the music itself, extracting features like tempo, rhythm, key, and loudness. This approach allows Spotify to recommend songs that are musically similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning, involving complex neural networks, helps Spotify make recommendations by learning from vast amounts of data and recognizing complex patterns. These networks are trained using both explicit feedback (such as likes and skips) and implicit feedback (such as the amount of time a user spends listening to a song or the time of day they listen).\n",
    "\n",
    "Spotify's personalized playlists, such as Discover Weekly and Daily Mixes, are examples of the recommender engine in action. These playlists, tailored to each user's unique musical tastes and listening habits, exemplify the power of machine learning in creating personalized experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we proceed with the workshop, I highly encourage everyone to watch this video to understand Spotify's recommender system in more detail. This will serve as the foundation of recommneder engine and deep learning for the rest of the week. In this video, Spotify's engineers share insights about the complex algorithms and vast datasets that power their recommendation engine.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, let's dive into the world of recommender systems by creating a simplified version of a music recommendation engine using Spotify's track data!"

    "# Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective of this code is to build a song recommendation engine using Spotify dataset. The dataset contains various features of songs such as acousticness, danceability, energy, instrumentalness, liveness, speechiness, and valence.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use these features to group or cluster the songs using the KMeans clustering algorithm, a popular machine learning algorithm for cluster analysis. The algorithm aims to partition the songs into clusters in which each song belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the clusters are created, the model will recommend songs to the user based on their favorite songs. The recommendations are made by identifying the cluster that most of the user's favorite songs belong to, and then suggesting other songs from the same cluster. The assumption here is that songs within the same cluster have similar features and therefore the user is likely to enjoy them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final output of the code is a list of song recommendations that are similar in nature to the user's favorite songs."
